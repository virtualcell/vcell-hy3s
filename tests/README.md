# Tests

```bash
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Five cases, about six seconds, no dependencies beyond what the solver already
needs — `hy3s_check` is C against the vendored NetCDF, so it builds wherever
the solver does.

## The model

`resources/enzyme.nc` is the sample model that shipped with the original
sources: Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics,

```
S + E ⇌ ES → E + P
```

with 60200 molecules each of S and E, run to t = 5 over 51 timepoints.

It was chosen because its stoichiometry yields two **exact** conservation laws:
enzyme `E + ES` and substrate `S + ES + P` are each constant at every timepoint.
Neither depends on the trajectory, so both hold for any seed, on any platform,
under any of the three integrators — and because molecule counts are integers
held in doubles, they hold to the bit. `hy3s_check` treats any drift at all as a
failure rather than applying a tolerance.

`P` can only be produced, never consumed, so it must also be non-decreasing.

Every case runs with `epsilon` and `lambda` set high enough that no reaction is
approximated as continuous. The run is then an exact stochastic simulation and
the SDE integrator — the only thing that differs between the three binaries — is
never entered. That is why one baseline serves all three, and why
`euler_maruyama` and `milstein` produce identical output.

## What each case covers

| case | covers |
| --- | --- |
| `euler_maruyama`, `milstein`, `milstein_adaptive` | each binary satisfies the invariants and reproduces the committed baseline |
| `euler_maruyama_other_seed` | the invariants hold on a different trajectory, so they constrain the solver rather than one run |
| `reproducibility` | 20 runs at one seed must agree exactly |

## Why `--ran`, and why 20 runs

Both exist because of one defect, found while splitting this repo out and fixed
in `dataio.f90`: `CheckAndDefineVariables` left its `intent(out)` error flag
undefined on the success path, so about one optimised run in five reported a
failure that had not happened and stopped — **while still exiting 0 and leaving
the output file untouched**.

So `--ran` asserts the solution actually reaches `TEnd` and is not all zeros. A
zero-filled file satisfies both conservation laws perfectly; without `--ran` the
invariants would sign off on a solver that did nothing.

The repeat count is not redundancy either. With the fix reverted, the three
single-run cases all still passed — a one-in-five failure hides easily. Twenty
runs caught it in five suite runs out of five. Anything that intermittent needs
repetition to be tested at all, and repeating asserts the property the defect
violated: same seed, same answer.

## The baselines — one per compiler

There are two, selected by `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID`:

| file | produced by |
| --- | --- |
| `resources/enzyme_baseline_gfortran.nc` | Linux and both macOS architectures |
| `resources/enzyme_baseline_intel.nc` | Windows |

They differ because **Fortran's `RANDOM_NUMBER` has no specified algorithm.**
gfortran and Intel run different generators, so the same seed produces a
different stream and a different — equally valid — trajectory. The trajectory is
therefore a property of the compiler, not the platform, which is why Linux,
macOS arm64 and macOS x86_64 all match each other to the bit while Intel
diverges from the first save point (`S` = 482 against 522).

The two are the same physics with different noise. Peak separation is 380
molecules out of 60200, about 0.6%, against a Poisson fluctuation scale of
√60200 ≈ 245; both end at 59788 and 59787 product respectively, both heading to
60200. Nothing about that is a defect — it is what two draws from the same
distribution look like.

This is the only trajectory-dependent check here, compared elementwise at
`rtol 1e-9`. It is a regression tripwire against unintended change, **not** a
statement that either trajectory is the correct one. If a job ever disagrees,
the invariants above are the checks to trust.

To regenerate after an intentional change, on a machine with the matching
compiler:

```bash
cp tests/resources/enzyme.nc /tmp/base.nc
build/bin/Hybrid_EM_x64 /tmp/base.nc 100000 1000000 0.01 1e-5 -R 12345 -OV
cp /tmp/base.nc tests/resources/enzyme_baseline_gfortran.nc   # or _intel.nc
```

The Intel one can only be produced on Windows. It was captured by temporarily
adding a step to the Windows CI job that ran the solver and uploaded the result
as an artifact; do the same if it ever needs regenerating.
