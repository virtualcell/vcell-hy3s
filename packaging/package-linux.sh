# directory runs wherever it is unpacked. glibc itself (libc, libm, libpthread,
# libdl, librt, the loader) and libgcc_s are left to the host: the build runs on
# a manylinux_2_28 base, so glibc >= 2.28 is all a host needs. Messaging is
# compiled in (a static, HTTP-only libcurl built in docker/Dockerfile), so the same
# directory is what the container image puts on PATH.
